When you have an issue, be sure you check and inform the following:

   - What version/commit of the packages do you have? how did you download them?
   - On what version of the underlying system are you? Pharo 11, Pharo12? Windows, linux, mac?
   - When did you download everything?
   - Did you try a fresh re-install?
   - Did it work before and then is stopped working? or it did never work?
   - Does it fail everywhere? Does it work in some machine and not in others?
   - Does it fail in your machine only? Do your colleagues have the same problem? How could you contact your colleagues?
   - Please do not send a screenshot of an exception. It's not enough: you should somehow share the entire error. Look at the options in the contextual menu of the debugger.

We expect persons in a profesional context to make the effort of verifying **at least** the points above before opening a bug report.
Once you checked, if the bug persists, make sure that the bug report has at least the minimum information to reproduce it somewhere in another machine.
