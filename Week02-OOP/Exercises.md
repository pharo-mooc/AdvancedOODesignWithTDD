# Exercises 

## Practice

To practice the OOP concepts we reviewed today, here are some exercises you can work on:
- Think about how to implement the boolean methods `|`, `or:`, `ifTrue:ifFalse:`. Write them down. Try to make your pseudo-code be syntactically valid please. **Tip:** Remember that to defer execution of code for the lazy version you can use block closures (i.e., `[ ... ]`), which are lambda expressions. To evaluate a lambda expression you can use the message `value` and its variants with arguments: `value:`, `value:value:` and so on...
- Do a pass on the lookup exercises from the slides. Do you get the correct result? Do you understand why? Try arriving until the cases with `super` send.
- Think about what does `self == super` return. Remember that `==` is the identity comparison, returning true if the compared objects are *the same* object

## Preparing Presentation

The main objective of this week's practice is to start preparing the presentation due in Week 5.
During this exercise you will have to analyze two existing software projects: AVL and Artefact.
Then, you will have to prepare a 10' presentation that shows two aspects of your analysis:

- What conclusions did you get from the data structure?
- *How* did you learn?


### Projects

- AVL is an implementation of balanced trees https://github.com/pharo-containers/AVL
- Artefact is a generator of PDF documents https://github.com/pharo-contributions/artefact

### Analysis

For each project perform *at least* the following analyses.

Tips:
- You can check the code from the Class browser,
- Execute examples from the playground,
- and inspect the results using the inspector.
- To execute the tests use DrTests (see menus)
- And check the options in the browser/playground (senders, implementors) what do they do and why are they useful?

#### From a user perspective
- Is there good starting documentation? Look for installation instructions, starting points, and examples.
- How do we use the project/library?
- What does it do? Why would you use it?
- What are the key classes to look at?

#### From an implementor/contributor perspective
- how is it implemented? Do you recognize some known patterns?
- what are the invariants? For AVL you will see plenty since it is a data structure. For Artefact, can you zoom into a feature and get some insights?
- what is the design?

#### What about tests
- Are there tests?, do they run?
- Is coverage good? Are there missing tests?
- What kind of tests do you find? Positive, negative, boundary checks?

#### Propose improvements
Either
- improving existing tests 
- proposing new (missing) tests
- if you find problems please open issues in the GitHub repository of the project
- you can also propose pull requests to address problems and improve the project
