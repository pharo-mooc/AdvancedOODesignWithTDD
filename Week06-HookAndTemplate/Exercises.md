## Practice -- Game

The practice of this week includes starting your game project.

## Choose a game

Check the list in https://github.com/UnivLille-Meta/Miage23/blob/main/Projects.md.
Choose a game from that list: you will implement it during the rest of the course.

Make a 1-page or 2-page design sketch document with the information below and upload it next to your weekly reports.
- what is the game about, what is the objective
- what kind of objects are there
- what are the interactions of the game (e.g., what happens when you click on an element or you press a key)
- does the game have time-based events? (e.g., in tetris blocks go down one row each second)

This will get you started with the design and model of your game, and help you identify what kind of features and tasks you need to work on and how to split the work in your team.

Start thinking on how could you:
 - test the features of your game (hint: check the tests in Myg for inspiration)
 - split the features of your game to implement them separately

## Investigate the game framework

Install the game framework we are going to use and explore the example games that already exist.
Check the instructions in https://github.com/UnivLille-Meta/Miage23/blob/main/Projects.md.

You can play the games, but do not forget to check the code too!!!

Pay particular attention to Sokoban and MineSweeper, since they are two different kind of games using multiple features of the framework.
